# raw-manga-dl

Simple tool for downloading manga from websites of various publishers. Meant to be somewhat dynamic to make it easier to add in new services that share similar DRM techniques. Only meant for raw Japanese manga; there are plenty of solutions available on Github for scraping websites that aggregrate English scanlations. 

***Note:*** this is not particularly functional nor is this project organized, so I do not recommend using this. However, it works okay for **my** personal use case. I wouldn't be surprised if it broke if used for yours. I am mostly doing this for fun and as practice. 

## To-do
- Fix sloppy imports and structure project more neatly.. 
- Add more services (https://comic-walker.com, https://web-ace.jp, and so on.)
- Add proper rate limiting.
- Refactor after implementing more DRM solvers, abstract common traits.
