# raw-manga-dl

Simple tool for downloading manga from websites of various publishers. Meant to be somewhat dynamic to make it easier to add in new services that share similar DRM techniques. Only meant for raw Japanese manga; there are plenty of solutions available on Github for scraping websites that aggregrate English scanlations. 

***Note:*** this is not yet functional nor is it organized. 

## To-do
- Make it actually CLI compatible.
- Fix sloppy imports and structure project more neatly.. 
- Add more services (https://comic-walker.com, https://web-ace.jp, and so on.)
- Add proper rate limiting.
- Refactor after implementing more DRM solvers, abstract common traits.
